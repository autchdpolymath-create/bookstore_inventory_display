Project Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive assessment of data interchange standards (XML and JSON) and their application in managing an online bookstore's catalog and inventory. It involves designing data structures and creating a web display.

Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project were to:

Design a Validated XML Structure: Create an XML Schema Definition (XSD) to rigidly define the structure and data types for the bookstore's complex catalog data.

Model JSON Inventory Data: Develop a contemporary JSON data structure to represent the bookstore's live inventory records.

This project demonstrates a hybrid data strategy, leveraging the unique benefits of both XML and JSON to handle different functional requirements within the online bookstore application.
